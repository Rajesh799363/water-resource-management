# Water Resource Management with Machine Learning

##  Overview
This project is a **Flask + ML + Frontend web app** that manages and predicts water demand.
Users can log daily water data (inflow, rainfall, outflow, demand), and the ML model predicts future demand.

## Features
- Add and manage water data  
- Train ML model on historical records  
- Predict future water demand  
- Visualize trends (future: can integrate Chart.js)  
- Backend: Flask + SQLite + scikit-learn  
- Frontend: HTML + CSS + JS
